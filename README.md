3. **Add your Google Maps API Key:**

   - Create a file named `constants.js` in the `src` directory.
   - Add the following code, replacing `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` with your actual API key:

   ```javascript
   const ApiKey = "YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY";
   exports.ApiKey = ApiKey;
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

npm run build
npm run deploy
```

## Usage

## Components

### `NavigationBar.js`

- Renders the navigation bar with links to submit events, view FAQs, and contact the site owner.

### `Map.js`

- Integrates Google Maps and displays event markers.
- Handles marker clicks to show event info windows.

### `MapMarker.js`

- Custom React component for rendering map markers with conditional styling.

### `TableAndMap.js`

## Data Management

### Google Sheets Integration

- Event data is stored in a Google Sheet.
- The app fetches data from the sheet using the Google Sheets API.
- To update event data, modify the Google Sheet and the changes will be reflected in the app.

### Google Sheet Setup

- Create a Google Sheet with the following columns:
  - `Name`, `Description`, `Category`, `Sub Category`, `Status`, `Organizer Name`, `Audience Entry Fee`, `Level`, `Language`, `Frequency`, `Weekday / Month`, `Time`, `Venue`, `Address`, `Wheelchair Access`, `Contact / Book a Spot`, `Facebook Group`, `Facebook Page`, `WhatsApp`, `Google Form`, `Email`, `Website`, `Latitude`, `Longitude`, `Update Info Form Link`, `RowNumber`
- Obtain the Google Sheet ID and update the `SpreadsheetId` in `TableAndMap.js`:
  ```javascript
  const SpreadsheetId = "YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID";
  ```
